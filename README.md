# ML_project_dsaa2011
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the DSAA2011 course project at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). The project focuses on analyzing the Dry Bean Dataset using various machine learning techniques.
## Dataset
Dataset Name: Dry Bean Dataset
Description: Contains 13,611 instances of dry bean measurements with 16 features (e.g., area, perimeter, major axis length, eccentricity) and 7 classes representing different bean varieties (e.g., Seker, Barbunya, Bombay).
## Project Tasks
### Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode non-numeric data, and standardize features.
### Data Visualization: Use t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D/3D space.
### Clustering Analysis: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) and evaluate the results.
### Prediction: Train and test supervised learning models (e.g., decision tree, logistic regression).
### Model Evaluation: Calculate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and draw ROC curves.
### Open-ended Exploration: Experiment with additional machine learning techniques to improve models.
